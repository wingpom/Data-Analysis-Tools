        <h2>I. Background</h2>
        <p>In experimental science, the goal is about making measurements. Any physical quantity, you're trying to
            measure has a 'true' value (theoretical value), for example gravity is 9.81 m/s^2. However, when conducting
            an experiment to measure gravity, you may not get that true value, because all real-life measuring devices
            are imperfect. 
            <ul>
                <li>a. For instance, sometimes your measurement tool may be improperly calibrated. This kind of
                    error is a systemtic error, where your measurements are skew in one direction.</li>
                <li>b. Other times, it can be different in both directions. This is called random error.</li>
            </ul>
            Theses errors are factored into your data and displayed graphically as error bars. These error bars, can be
            in both directions (X and Y), or just one direction (X or Y). They illustrate a range where most of your
            measurements falls within.
        </p>
        <h2>II. Uncertainties and Final Results</h2>
        <p> Using the uncertainties, mathematically, if two quantities a and b, with uncertainties ∆a
            and ∆b are compared, they can be considered to agree within
            their uncertainties if: <br>
            |a − b| ≤ ∆a + ∆b <br>
            A value with no uncertainty given can be assumed to have an
            uncertainty of zero.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            The following tool, show a visual representation if two quantities agree. <br>
            <b>Note: For this application, all values must be filled, if there's is no uncertainty in a particular value, put in 0.</b>
